# Favorite Command Line Tools
## These are my favorite command line tools for reporting 

There are many, many things one can do with through the command line, and the key to doing that is the many easy tools a reporter can employ to do very powerful things. Whereas a news app developer or someone who does code full time employs an array of tools and programming languages in everyday work, I'm just a reporter who tries to take advantage of handy tools to help me get my job done. Using the command line is not coding, but it can be just as powerful and save you tons of time and energy.
